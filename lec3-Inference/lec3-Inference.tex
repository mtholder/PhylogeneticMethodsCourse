\section*{terminology: genealogical trees within population or species trees}
It is tempting to refer to the tips of these gene trees as alleles or haplotypes.
\begin{compactitem}
	\item allele -- an alternative form a gene. 
	\item haplotype -- a linked set of alleles
\end{compactitem}
But both of these terms require a differences in sequence.

The gene trees that we draw depict genealogical relationships -- regardless of whether or not nucleotide differences distinguish the ``gene copies'' at the tips of the tree.

\section*{The main subject of this course: estimating a tree from character data}
Tree construction:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item strictly algorithmic approaches - use a ``recipe'' to construct a tree
	\item optimality based approaches - choose a way to ``score'' a trees and then search for the tree that has the best score.
\end{compactitem}
Expressing support for aspects of the tree:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item bootstrapping,
	\item testing competing trees against each other,
	\item posterior probabilities (in Bayesian approaches).
\end{compactitem}

The meaning of homology ({\bf very roughly}):
\begin{compactenum}
	\item comparable (when applied to characters) 
	\item identical by descent (when applied to character states) 
\end{compactenum}

Ideally, each possible character state would arise once in the 
entire history of life on earth.

\section*{Inference}
``deriving a conclusion based solely on what one already knows''\footnote{definition from Wikipedia, so it must be correct!}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item logical
	\item statistical

\myNewSlide
\section*{Logical Inference}
Deductive reasoning:
\begin{compactenum}
	\item start from premises
	\item apply proper rules
	\item arrive at statements that were not obviously contained in the premises.
\end{compactenum}
If the rules are valid (logically sound) and the premises are true, then the conclusions are {\em guaranteed} to be true.

\myNewSlide
\section*{Deductive reasoning}
\begin{verbatim}
All men are mortal.
Socrates is a man.
-------------------
Therefore Socrates is mortal. 
\end{verbatim}
\vskip 3cm
Can we infer phylogenies from character data using deductive reasoning?

\myNewSlide
\section*{Logical approach to phylogenetics}
Premise: The following character matrix is correctly coded (character states are 
homologous in the strict sense):\\

\begin{table}[htdp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|c}
 & {1} \\
\hline
{taxon A} & Z\\
{taxon B}  & Y \\
{taxon C}  & Y \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{default}
\end{table}

Is there a valid set of rules that will generate the tree
as a conclusion?

\myNewSlide
\section*{Logical approach to phylogenetics (cont)}
Rule: Two taxa that share a character state must be more closely
related to each other than either is to a taxon that displays
a different state.

Is this a valid rule?

\myNewSlide
\section*{Invalid rule}
Here is an example in which we are confident that the homology statements
are correct, but our rule implies two conflicting trees:
\begin{table}[htdp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
 & {\begin{sideways}\parbox{15mm}{placenta}\end{sideways}} & {\begin{sideways}\parbox{35mm}{vertebra}\end{sideways}}\\
\hline
{\em Homo sapiens} & Z & A \\
{\em Rana catesbiana}  & Y & A \\
{\em Drosophila melanogaster}  & Y & B \\

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{default}
\end{table}

\myNewSlide
\section*{Hennigian logical analysis}
The German entomologist Willi Hennig (in addition to 
providing strong arguments for phylogenetic classifications)
clarified the logic of phylogenetic inference.

Hennig's correction to our rule: Two taxa that share a 
{\bf derived} character state must be more closely
related to each other than either is to a taxon that 
displays the {\bf primitive} state.



\myNewSlide
\section*{Hennig's logic is valid}
Here we will use 0 for the primitive state, and 1 for the derived state.
\begin{table}[htdp]
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
 & {\begin{sideways}\parbox{15mm}{placenta}\end{sideways}} & {\begin{sideways}\parbox{35mm}{vertebra}\end{sideways}}\\
\hline
{\em Homo sapiens} & 1 & 1 \\
{\em Rana catesbiana}  & 0 & 1 \\
{\em Drosophila melanogaster}  & 0 & 0 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{default}
\end{table}
Now the character ``placenta'' does not provide a grouping, but ``vertebra''
groups human and frog as sister taxa.

\myNewSlide
\section*{Hennigian terminology}
prefixes:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item ``apo'' - refers to the new or derived state
	\item ``plesio'' - refers to the primitive state
    \item ``syn'' or ``sym'' - used to indicate shared between taxa
    \item ``aut'' - used to indicate a state being unique to one taxon
\end{compactitem}

\myNewSlide
\section*{Hennigian rules}
\begin{compactitem}
	\item synapomorphy - shared, derived states. Used to diagnose monophyletic groups.
	\item symplesiomorphy - shared, primitive states. Diagnose icky, unwanted paraphyletic groups.
	 \item autapomorphy -- a unique derived state. {\bf No} evidence of phylogenetic relationships.
	 \item constant characters -- columns in a matrix with no variability between taxa. {\bf No} evidence of phylogenetic relationships.
\end{compactitem}

\myNewSlide
\section*{Hennigian inference}
When we create a character matrix for Hennig's system, it is crucial that:
\begin{compactitem}
	\item traits assigned the same state represent homologous states (trace back to the MRCA)
	\item we correctly identify the directionality of the transformations (which state is plesiomorphic and which is apomorphic).
	The process of identifying the direction of change is called polarization.
\end{compactitem}

Polarization could be done based on developmental considerations, paleontological evidence, or biogeographic considerations, but the most common technique is outgroup polarization.
