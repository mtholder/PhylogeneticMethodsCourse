\section*{M$k$ models}
$k$-state variants of the Jukes-Cantor model -- all rates equal.

$$\Pr(i\rightarrow i|\nu) = \frac{1}{k} + \left(\frac{k-1}{k}\right)e^{-\left(\frac{k}{k-1}\right)\nu}$$\\
$$\Pr(i\rightarrow j|\nu) = \frac{1}{k} - \left(\frac{1}{k}\right)e^{-\left(\frac{k}{k-1}\right)\nu} $$

\section*{Sampling morphological characters}
Using our models assumes that our characters can be thought of as having been a random sample from a universe of $iid$ characters.

\begin{compactenum}
	\item We never have constant morphological characters.
	\begin{compactenum}
		\item There are plenty of attributes that do not vary.
		\item The ``rules'' of coding morphological characters are well-defined.
		\item How many constant characters ``belong'' in our matrix?
	\end{compactenum}
\end{compactenum}

\section*{Solutions to the lack of constant characters}

\begin{compactenum}
	\item Score our taxa for a random selection of characters -- {\em not} a selection of characters that are chosen because they are appropriate for our group.  (Is this possible or desirable?)
	\item Account for the fact that our data is filtered.
\end{compactenum}

\section*{M$k_v$ model}
Introduced by \citet{Lewis2001} using a trick Felsenstein used for restriction site data.

We condition our inference on the fact that we know that (by design) our characters are variable.

If ${\mathcal V}$ is the set of variable data patterns, then we do inference on:

$$ \Pr(x_i|T,\nu, x_i\in {\mathcal V}) $$
rather than:
$$ \Pr(x_i|T,\nu) $$

\myNewSlide
\section*{Conditional likelihood}

If $x_i\in {\mathcal V}$, then:
$$  \Pr(x_i|T,\nu, x_i\in {\mathcal V}) \Pr(x_i\in {\mathcal V} |T,\nu) = \Pr(x_i|T,\nu)  $$

So:
$$ \Pr(x_i|T,\nu, x_i\in {\mathcal V}) = \frac{\Pr(x_i|T,\nu)}{\Pr(x_i\in {\mathcal V} |T,\nu)}$$


\myNewSlide
Note that:
$$\Pr(x_i\in {\mathcal V} |T,\nu) = 1 - \Pr(x_i\notin {\mathcal V} |T,\nu)$$

If $ {\mathcal C}$ is the set of constant data patterns:
$$x_i\notin {\mathcal V} \equiv x_i\in {\mathcal C}$$
So:
$$\Pr(x_i\in {\mathcal V} |T,\nu) = 1 - \Pr(x_i\in {\mathcal C} |T,\nu)$$
There are not that many constant patterns, so we can just calculate the likelihood for each one of them.

\section*{Inference under M$2_v$}
\begin{compactenum}
	\item Calculate $\Pr(x_i|T,\nu)$ for each site $i$
	\item Calculate $$\Pr(x\in{\mathcal C}|T,\nu) = \Pr(000\ldots0 |T,\nu) + \Pr(111\ldots1 |T,\nu)$$
	\item For each site, calculate:
		$$ \Pr(x_i|T,\nu, x_i\in{\mathcal V}) = \frac{\Pr(x_i|T,\nu)}{1 - \Pr(x\in{\mathcal C}|T,\nu)} $$
	\item Take the product of $\Pr(x_i|T,\nu, x_i\in{\mathcal V})$ over all characters.
\end{compactenum}

\section*{M$k_v$ and M$k_{pars-inf}$}
The following were proved by \citet{AllmanHR2010}
\begin{compactenum}
	\item M$k_v$ is a consistent estimator of the tree and branch lengths,
	\item If you filter your data to only contain parsimony-informative charecters:
		\begin{compactenum}
			\item A four-leaf tree cannot be identified!
			\item Trees of eight or more leaves can be identified using inference under M$k_{pars-inf}$
		\end{compactenum}
\end{compactenum}

\section*{Can we estimate biases in state-transitions and state frequencies from morphological data?}
Of course! (remember Pagel's model, which we have already encountered).

But we have to bear in mind that $0$ in one character has nothing to do with $0$ in another.

This means that we have to use character-specific parameters or mixtures models (to reduce the number of parameters).  Typically this is done in a Bayesian setting.

\section*{Other tidbits about likelihood modeling of non-molecular data}
\large
\begin{compactenum}
	\item We can use the No-common-mechanism model \citep{TuffleyS1997} to generate a likelihood score from a parsimony score (for combined analyses).
	\item By setting some rates to 0 we can test transformation assumptions about irreversibility.
	\item Modification to the pruning algorithm lead to models of Dollo's law (no independent gain of a character state). For further details, see \citet{AlekseyenkoLS2008}.
	\item The use of ontologies to describe characters may revolutionize modeling of morphological data and the prospects for constructing ``morphological super-matrices''
\end{compactenum}
