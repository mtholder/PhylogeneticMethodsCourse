<h1>Goals of the lab</h1>
<p>Most of the software applications that we use throughout the course will be command-line tools.
The goal of this lab is to make sure that you are all familar with the basic commands used
to navigate a unix command line.

<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<p>We'll be using an excellent tutorial by Michael Stonebank -- <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/"> http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/</a></p>

<p>Specifically, I recommend:</p>
<ol>
    <li> <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unixintro.html">the introduction</a>,</li>
	<li> tutorials <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix1.html">one,</a></li>
	<li> tutorial <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix2.html">two,</a> and</li>
	<li> sections 5.1 and 5.2 of <a href="http://info.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Teaching/Unix/unix5.html">tutorial 5</a>,</li>
</ol>

<h3>Remote access tutorial</h3>
<p>Some of the analyses that we do will be run on clusters of computers (rather than the imacs in the lab).
Becoming comfortable working on a remote machine is not too difficult, and is a valuable skill.
The two most common tasks are logging in (typically accomplished using <tt>ssh</tt>) and copying files back and forth (usually done with <tt>scp</tt>).
Fortunately, <tt>scp</tt> uses basically the same syntax as the <tt>cp</tt> command that occurs in the previous tutorial.
I recommend <a href="http://www.linuxtutorialblog.com/post/ssh-and-scp-howto-tips-tricks">this blog</a> for an intro to <tt>ssh</tt> and <tt>scp</tt>.

<h2>Text editor</h2>
We will need to use text editors (rather than word processors) for modifying the files that we use throughout the course.
I highly recommend that you become comfortable with at least one good text editor.
<h3>For Mac</h3>
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a>,</li>
    <li> its free version <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler">TextWrangler</a>, or </li>
    <li><a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate</a></li>
</ol>
are all good choices.

<h3>For Windows</h3>
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org">NotePad++</a> 
</ol>
is a good, free editor.

<h3>For any platform</h3>
<ol>
    <li><a href="http://www.jedit.org/">jEdit</a> 
</ol>
is a good, free editor.

<h2>test_execute.py script</h2>
After you are comfortable, then try running the test_execute.py script
from a couple of different locations.  Try passing in files as arguments.
Try launching it, opening a new Terminal window and killing the test_execute.py
process (the executable that is running is listed as Python or python).
