\section*{Inconsistency of estimation from concatenated gene sequences}
\citet{DegnanR2006} show that the most likely topology for a gene tree
is not necessarily the tree that agrees with the 
phylogenetic tree.

For some phylogenetic shapes (e.g. imbalanced trees
with short internal nodes) there exists (at least) one other tree shape
that has a higher probability of agreeing with a gene tree.

Argues for explicitly considering the coalescent process in phylogenetic inference.

\section*{BEST -- importance sampling}
\begin{compactenum}
	\item Generate a collection of gene trees, $\bm{G}$, using an approximation of the coalescent prior
	\item Sample from the distribution of the species trees conditional on the gene trees, $\bm{G}$.
	\item Use ``importance weights'' to correct the sample for the fact that an approximate prior was used

			\item $Pr^{\dag}(\bm{G})$ is an approximate prior on gene trees from using a ``maximal'' species tree.

\section*{BEST -- conclusions}
\begin{compactenum}
	\item very expensive computationally (long MrBayes runs are needed)
	\item should correctly deal with the variability in gene tree caused by the coalescent process.
\end{compactenum}

\section*{$\ast$BEST}
Similar model to BEST, but {\em much} more efficient implementation.

Both will be very sensitive to migration, but they represent the state-of-the-art for estimating species trees from gene trees.
