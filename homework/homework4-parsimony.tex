\section*{Homework 4 (due Wed, Sept 22)}
\begin{compactenum}
	\item Print out and fill in the next three pages:
		\begin{compactitem}
			\item Assume a step-matrix in which transitions cost 1 step but transversions cost 2 steps.
			\item As data, use a character in which  {\tt A} is the state for taxa 1 and 2 , taxon 3 has state {\tt G}, and taxon 4 has a {\tt C}
		\end{compactitem}
	\item On each page:
	\begin{compactenum}
		\item Fill in the circle with character state (either the observed data for tips or the inferred states)
		\item There are 16 trees on each page, use them to show all 16 possible ancestral character state combinations.
		\item Add 0, 1, or 2 tick marks to each branch to indicate the cost of the change across the branch.
		\item Circle the most parsimonious character state reconstruction(s) for each tree.
		\item Write the trees parsimony score by the tree at the top of the page.
